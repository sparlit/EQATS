"""The workflow executor's pure half. Plain asserts, no framework, no database, no model:

execute() takes an `on_node` callback and does no persistence itself, which is what lets a whole
graph run here against fake tools. The cases worth pinning are the ones that decide whether a
wired workflow means anything: dependency order, a node only seeing what it is wired to, template
types surviving (`{{ x }}` must hand a LIST to for_each, not the text of one), the fan-out, and
that one broken node doesn't take the run with it.
