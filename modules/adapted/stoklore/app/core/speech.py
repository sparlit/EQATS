"""Speech to text with Whisper, locally - nothing recorded here ever leaves the machine.

Runs on the `transformers` + `torch` already installed for the sentiment model, so voice capture
adds no new dependency. The browser sends 16 kHz mono WAV (see frontend/src/lib/voice.ts), which is
read with the standard library's `wave` module: the transformers pipeline can accept encoded audio
(mp3/webm) too, but only by shelling out to ffmpeg, which isn't installed here and isn't worth
requiring for something the browser can do itself.
