"""Paper trading engine: watches open positions against live prices and fires simulated exits.

Relationship to Bar Replay's orderEngine.js - the two are deliberately NOT shared code, and it's
worth knowing why before "deduplicating" them. Bar Replay matches against a *bar*: it has an OHLC
range, so a level is hit when [low, high] contains it, and a bar whose whole range sits past a
level counts as gapping through and fills at the bar's open. Here there is no range - polling
yields a sequence of last-traded prices - so a level is hit when the latest price has crossed it,
and there is no "open" to fall back to. Same semantics (laddered legs, per-leg quantities,
stop-loss wins), genuinely different arithmetic. What IS shared is the leg shape: {id, price, qty},
so a ladder means the same thing in both places and the frontend can render either.

A closed position becomes a manual_trades row (tagged 'paper', under the paper account) rather
than living in a paper-specific history table - so every statistic the journal already computes
applies to paper trades with no second implementation.
