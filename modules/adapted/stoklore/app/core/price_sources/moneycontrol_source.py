know which one actually ran.

Caveat: moneycontrol's `symbol` param is its own scrip code, which isn't guaranteed to match the
plain NSE ticker for every stock (it happens to for the ones this was tested against) - there's
no symbol-mapping table here, so an unmapped symbol will just come back empty/404 rather than
silently fetching the wrong stock.
