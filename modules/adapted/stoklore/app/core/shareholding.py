"""Promoter shareholding, and - the point of the whole module - HOW it changed.

A promoter going 15% -> 66% in one quarter and 15% -> 18% over four quarters both "went up", and
they mean nearly opposite things. Gradual accumulation is usually open-market buying with the
promoter's own money: real skin in the game. A sudden jump almost never is - it is a preferential
allotment, a warrant conversion, a reclassification or a change of control, and which one it is
decides whether it is bullish or a warning.

The percentages CANNOT tell those apart, and this is the fact the module is built around. Every
category sums to 100, so issuing new shares to promoters pushes promoter% up and public% down by
exactly the shape that buying from the public would. Worked example, AJOONI's 2026 filings:

    30-JUN   promoter 46,324,766 (26.89%)   public 125,918,832 (73.11%)   total 172,243,598
    12-AUG   promoter 55,324,766 (30.53%)   public 125,918,832 (69.47%)   total 181,243,598

Promoter +3.64pp, and the public sold nothing at all - their share count is identical to the digit.
Nine million new shares were issued to a sixth promoter entity that did not exist the quarter
before. On percentages alone that reads as accumulation; it is dilution of everyone else.

So the ledger stores SHARE COUNTS, and the verdicts below are decided on them:

    total flat + promoter up + public down   -> bought from the public (organic)
    total up   + promoter up ~= total delta  -> shares issued TO the promoter (not a purchase)
    total up   + promoter flat               -> everyone else diluted
    total flat + promoter entity count drops -> looks like reclassification, needs the filing read

Two data sources, deliberately unequal in cost:

  * `/api/corporate-share-holdings-master` - ONE call covers every listed company for a date range
    (~2,500 filings per quarter). Percentages only, but it is what makes a daily sweep affordable.
  * the per-filing XBRL - ~85-270 KB each, and the only place share and shareholder counts live.
    Fetched only for filings that actually moved (see needs_detail), and only once ever: a filing
    is immutable, and a revision arrives as its own row with its own recordId.

Nothing here decides that a corporate action was good or bad - that needs the filing itself read by
a person. It decides which handful of stocks are worth reading, instead of eyeballing shareholding
tables across a whole watchlist every quarter.
