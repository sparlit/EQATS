"""Intraday bars for Bar Replay's 15m/1H/4H timeframes, from the HuggingFace dataset
`xxparthparekhxx/indian-stock-market-minute-data` (2,535 NSE symbols, 2022-01 -> 2026-01, ~715M
minute rows in 8 x ~1.5GB parquet shards), falling back to yfinance for symbols it doesn't cover.

Nothing is downloaded ahead of time. The shards are sorted by symbol, so DuckDB's parquet reader
prunes on row-group statistics and pulls only the matching ranges over HTTP range requests -
a symbol extract touches a few MB of a 10.5GB dataset, not the whole thing.

    hf://datasets/<repo>/minute/*.parquet  ->  WHERE symbol = ?  ->  local_data/minute/<SYM>.parquet

The extract is cached to that local parquet on first use (RELIANCE: ~375k rows, 6.6MB, ~11s) and
every later request - any timeframe, any date - resamples off the local copy in well under a
second. `local_data/` is already gitignored. Delete a cached file to refetch it.

The dataset stops at 2026-01, so the cache is then TOPPED UP with every newer 1m bar: from
moneycontrol's chart feed (about a year of 1m history, so it covers the gap and today), or
yfinance's 7-day 1m window when moneycontrol has nothing for the symbol. At most once per
TOPUP_EVERY per symbol, appended to the same parquet - see _top_up.

Minute history can still have holes no feed fills: a stock the dataset doesn't carry (NSE SME
listings) has only moneycontrol's last year of 1m, and some stocks' moneycontrol 1m starts only days
ago, leaving months between the dataset's end and it. The official DAILY record is complete for
both, so it is cached beside the minutes (`<SYM>.daily.parquet`) and used two ways: 1D bars take a
missing day from it (fill_days), and every run can say how many sessions its bars lack
(missing_sessions) instead of hiding the hole.

The `datasets` library route (`load_dataset(..., split="minute").filter(...)`) is the documented
one but materializes all 10.5GB before filtering; DuckDB was chosen to keep this a per-symbol
streaming read. Dataset columns: symbol, timestamp (UTC), open, high, low, close, volume, oi.
