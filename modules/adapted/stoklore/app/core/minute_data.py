"""Intraday bars for Bar Replay's 15m/1H/4H timeframes, from the HuggingFace dataset
`xxparthparekhxx/indian-stock-market-minute-data` (2,535 NSE symbols, 2022-01 -> 2026-01, ~715M
minute rows in 8 x ~1.5GB parquet shards), falling back to yfinance for symbols it doesn't cover.

Nothing is downloaded ahead of time. The shards are sorted by symbol, so DuckDB's parquet reader
prunes on row-group statistics and pulls only the matching ranges over HTTP range requests -
a symbol extract touches a few MB of a 10.5GB dataset, not the whole thing.

    hf://datasets/<repo>/minute/*.parquet  ->  WHERE symbol = ?  ->  local_data/minute/<SYM>.parquet

The extract is cached to that local parquet on first use (RELIANCE: ~375k rows, 6.6MB, ~11s) and
every later request - any timeframe, any date - resamples off the local copy in well under a
second. `local_data/` is already gitignored. Delete a cached file to refetch it.

The `datasets` library route (`load_dataset(..., split="minute").filter(...)`) is the documented
one but materializes all 10.5GB before filtering; DuckDB was chosen to keep this a per-symbol
streaming read. Dataset columns: symbol, timestamp (UTC), open, high, low, close, volume, oi.
