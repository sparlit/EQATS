"""One-dump-per-day pg_dump backups of the live database, kept current in the background.

Motivation: this DB holds a hand-typed trade journal that cannot be retyped, Postgres here runs
with archive_mode=off (so there is no point-in-time recovery), and a single bad DELETE already
destroyed the whole `manual_trades` table once. This is the safety net for that.

Design - "parallel" means a background thread, not dual writes:
  - Any mutating HTTP request marks the DB dirty (one middleware in api.py, so new endpoints are
    covered automatically - nothing to remember to wire up).
  - A daemon thread dumps at most once per BACKUP_MIN_INTERVAL, and only when dirty. Bursts of
    writes therefore cost one dump, and an idle app costs nothing at all.
  - The file is named for today's date (crawler-YYYY-MM-DD.dump) and OVERWRITTEN on every dump
    that day - a sync never creates a second file for the same day, it just brings today's file
    up to date. Only the last KEEP_DAYS calendar days are kept; older ones are deleted after
    every dump, so retention self-heals even across a period the app wasn't running.
  - Dumps are pg_dump's custom format (-Fc), which allows restoring ONE table without touching the
    rest - the exact shape of the accident this exists to undo:
        pg_restore -d crawler --data-only -t manual_trades backups/<file>.dump
    Whole database:
        pg_restore -d crawler --clean backups/<file>.dump
