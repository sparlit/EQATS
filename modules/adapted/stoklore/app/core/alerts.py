"""Alerts: a price condition worth being told about, and the things the broker did while you
weren't looking.

Two kinds share one table and one feed, because they answer the same question - "what happened
that I should know about" - and a trader watching a position does not want two inboxes:

- **price** alerts are the ones you set: a symbol, a condition, and one or two levels.
- **order** alerts are written by the live mirror when Dhan reports a fill, a rejection or a
  position going flat. Nobody sets those; they are what the account did.

Deliberately not a rule engine. app/core/rules.py already evaluates multi-criterion watch rules
against fundamentals and events; that is a research question asked on demand. This is one number
against one or two levels, swept every few seconds while the market is open, and the two would
only be one feature if you squint from far enough away to miss that one of them costs a scrape
per check.

--- what a condition can be, and what that costs -------------------------------------------------

Nine of the thirteen conditions are STATELESS - they read the current price and nothing else, so a
poll that lands late still fires. Four are STATEFUL: crossing, crossing up, crossing down and the
two channel-transition ones need to know where the price was last time, which this stores per
alert as `last_price`.

The stateful ones can miss. The sweep sees the price every POLL_SECONDS on a delayed feed, so a
price that crosses 100 and comes back inside one interval never produces two observations either
side of the level, and the alert stays quiet. That is not a bug to be fixed here; it is what
polling a delayed quote can see. Which is exactly why `greater`/`less` exist beside
`crossing_up`/`crossing_down`: for "tell me if it gets there at all", a level test cannot miss,
and it is the one to pick when being told matters more than being told at the instant.

The moving_* conditions measure from the alert's own `reference_price` - the price when it was
armed, re-captured each time it fires - NOT from the previous bar the way a charting package
does. A bar's move is invisible to a poller that only ever sees a last price, and "it moved 5%
since I set this" is both answerable and the question a swing trader is actually asking.
