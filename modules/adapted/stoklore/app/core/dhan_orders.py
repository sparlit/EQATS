"""Dhan v2 order API - the write half of app/core/broker.py, which only ever reads.

This module never simulates anything. app/core/paper.py owns a position and decides when it fills;
here the BROKER owns the position and this is a mirror plus a way to send intent. Nothing in the
app may infer a fill: a fill is what Dhan's order book says it is, and everything downstream (the
positions screen, the journal, the alerts) reads that mirror rather than a local guess. Two
sources of truth for one position is how an account ends up sold twice.

Money moves through these functions, so they are arranged for one property above all others: the
network call is the last thing that happens. Everything that can be decided without it - the
payload, every guardrail, the symbol lookup - is a pure function above the line, checked by
tests/live_trading.selfcheck.py without credentials or a socket. `send()` at the bottom is the
only thing that talks to Dhan.

Fields follow https://dhanhq.co/docs/v2/orders/ and /super-order/.
