"""Single-user login: a password + PIN to trust a browser, then the PIN alone for 48 hours.

The app is local-first but reachable through a Cloudflare tunnel (see the CORS block in main.py),
so this is written for the exposed case, not the localhost one.

What that means concretely:

- **Nothing reversible is stored.** Password and PIN are hashed with scrypt (stdlib `hashlib`, no
  new dependency - memory-hard, so a stolen database is expensive to attack offline), each with its
  own 16-byte salt.
- **There is no default account.** Until someone completes setup the app has no credentials at all,
  and setup is refused for a proxied request, so the tunnel can't be used to claim an instance
  before its owner does.
- **The PIN alone only works on a browser that already passed the full login**, and only for
  DEVICE_TRUST. A stranger has no device cookie, so the PIN is not a guessable entry point at all:
  where an exposed PIN-only login would allow hundreds of tries a day, this allows
  DEVICE_PIN_ATTEMPTS from an already-trusted browser before that browser is demoted.
- **The session token never touches the database in usable form.** The cookie holds a 256-bit
  random token; only its SHA-256 is stored, so a database dump doesn't hand over live sessions.
- **Every comparison is constant-time** (`hmac.compare_digest`) - a timing oracle on the username
  or the PIN would be a free hint.
- **Guessing is rate-limited** with an exponential lockout per client, and the failure reply never
  says which of the three fields was wrong.

Enforcement lives in main.py's middleware, not here: this module is the vocabulary, and the
self-check (tests/auth.selfcheck.py) exercises it without a database.
