"""Shared outbound HTTP for every scrape in this app - anti-block transport, one place.

Every fetch in scraper.py (and price_sources/) goes through here instead of calling requests.get
directly, so the "don't look like a bot" behaviour is configured once rather than re-derived at
each call site. What it does, and who actually implements it:

  * Browser TLS/JA3 + HTTP2 fingerprint - scrapling's `impersonate` (curl_cffi under the hood).
    A plain `requests` call has a Python-shaped TLS handshake that Cloudflare/Akamai flag before
    a single header is read, which is why header-only tricks stop working on protected sites.
  * Real browser headers (User-Agent, Accept*, Sec-Ch-Ua, and a plausible Referer) - scrapling's
    `stealthy_headers=True` generates a coherent set per request. Coherent matters: a Chrome UA
    with Firefox's Accept header is a stronger bot signal than a boring UA would have been, so
    this deliberately does NOT hand-roll UA rotation on top of it.
  * Residential/rotating proxy support - scrapling's ProxyRotator, fed from $SCRAPER_PROXIES.
  * Session rotation - cookie jars are recycled (see _SESSION_MAX_USES) rather than one jar
    serving thousands of requests, and each rotation re-rolls the fingerprint.
  * Politeness throttle + jitter, and 429-aware exponential backoff - implemented here, since
    the point is to send FEWER requests, which no library can decide on your behalf.

On being a good citizen: the throttle and the backoff are the parts that matter most. Scraping
faster than a human plausibly browses is what gets an IP banned, and it is also what actually
costs the site money. Defaults here are deliberately unhurried; the app's own DB caching layer
(db.get_cached / api._cached) means most of these calls never leave the process anyway.
