"""What the chart looked like when a trade was taken, plus how far it ran either way.

Computed ONCE, at trade creation, and stored on the row (manual_trades.trade_context). Never
recomputed on read - same reasoning as account_balance_at_trade (see db.py's column comment): it's
a point-in-time fact, and bars get split-adjusted and revised behind you. Recomputing it later
would silently rewrite the history you're trying to learn from.

Two halves:

  Entry context  - trend, volatility regime, how extended the entry was, where in the recent range
                   it sat. Computed from the ~100 daily bars BEFORE the entry. Lets trades be
                   bucketed later by market condition ("do I only lose when I chase?").

  MAE / MFE      - Maximum Adverse / Favourable Excursion (John Sweeney). How far the trade went
                   against you before it worked, and how far in your favour before you closed it.
                   Diagnoses execution rather than the market: stops too wide, stops too tight,
                   entries too early, winners cut short. Needs an exit date; absent one, these
                   keys are simply not present.

Everything here reads the local DB only - no network. That matters: the bulk-import dialog fires
N parallel POSTs, and a per-trade network fetch would make it unusable.
