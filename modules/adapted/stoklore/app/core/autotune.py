"""Walk-forward parameter tuning for one stock - Phase 1 of docs/autotune-blueprint.md.

Tune on `train` sessions, trade the next `test` sessions with what was picked, never having seen
them, then roll forward by `test` and do it again. The stitched out-of-sample (OOS) curve is the
only performance number this reports as real; the in-sample figures are shown only as the promise
the OOS curve is measured against.

    sessions  |------ train ------|-- test --|
                         |------ train ------|-- test --|           ...
    per window: grid sweep on train -> plateau score -> pick (with hysteresis)
                -> backtest the pick on warm-up + test bars with --trade-from=<test start>
                -> the same for the strategy's fixed defaults (the baseline to beat)

The engine is injected (`engine(*args) -> parsed JSON`), so tests/autotune.selfcheck.py can run
the whole loop against a fake one. Everything else here is pure.

Summaries of single runs are the engine's own. Only the stitching of several windows into one OOS
figure is computed here (`stitch`), with the engine's definitions (core.hpp `summarize`): profit
factor and win rate on per-trade gross P&L, Sharpe on daily P&L annualised by sqrt(252).
