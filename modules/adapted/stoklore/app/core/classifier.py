"""Typed classification with Laya - a local, non-autoregressive decision model (the open-source
alternative to Jev). It answers a question about a piece of text in one forward pass, with a
calibrated confidence, and never generates text:

    choice  pick one label           -> {"choice", "probabilities", "confidence"}
    score   a point on an ordinal scale -> {"score" (expected index), "legend", "confidence"}
    noul    yes/no                   -> {"noul" (probability of yes), "confidence"}

It sits beside the chat LLM, not instead of it: guard rails on chat input and tool results, tags on
scraped news, mistake/emotion suggestions in the trade journal, and a `classify_text` tool the
agent and workflows can call. Every caller treats it as optional - off in Settings, not installed,
or the model failing to load all mean "behave exactly as before", never an error.
