"""BSE's active-equity scrip list, in the row shape db.upsert_stocks_master already takes.

NSE ships CSVs a person downloads and uploads; BSE serves the whole list as one JSON call - ~4,979
active equity scrips with the scrip code, trading symbol, ISIN and issuer name. So this importer
needs no file picker, which is why it is a button rather than an upload form.

The ISIN is the load-bearing field. Most BSE names are the same companies already listed on NSE,
and importing them as new rows would double the master, split every watchlist and give one company
two stock pages. So a row whose ISIN already exists is merged onto the NSE row - it only attaches
`bse_code` - and only genuinely BSE-EXCLUSIVE scrips become rows of their own. See
db.upsert_bse_master for the merge itself.
