"""Login, unlock, recovery and one-time setup. Everything else in the app is gated by the
middleware in main.py; these endpoints are the only ones it lets through unauthenticated.

The shape of it:

    setup     once, from the machine itself      -> account + recovery code + session + trust
    login     password + PIN                     -> session + 48h device trust
    unlock    PIN alone, trusted browser only    -> session
    recover   one-time code + new credentials    -> works from anywhere, revokes everything else

There is deliberately NO reset endpoint. An HTTP reset that needs no credentials is reachable by
any page your browser happens to open - `fetch('http://localhost:8010/...', {mode: 'no-cors'})`
sends the request whatever CORS says about reading the reply, and needs no cookie to do it. So the
only way to wipe a forgotten login is the script on the machine: `python -m app.reset_login`.
