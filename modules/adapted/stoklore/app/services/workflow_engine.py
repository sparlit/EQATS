"""Running a hand-wired workflow: no model deciding what to do, no human watching it happen.

The Chat tab is the agent choosing its own tools a turn at a time. A workflow is the opposite
contract - YOU wired the graph, so the same graph runs the same way every time, and the only
thing left to decide at run time is what the data says.

A workflow is nodes + edges (stored whole on `workflows.graph`). Four node kinds:

    trigger    what sets the workflow off - schedule, manual, or after the daily event scan
    tool       one of the agent's own tools (app/services/agent.py), with arguments you fill in
    agent      one LLM call: a prompt with upstream data pasted into it, producing text
    condition  a gate - everything downstream is SKIPPED unless the comparison holds
    collect    appends rows to a named series, so the workflow builds up data over time
    output     what to do with the result - file it to the alerts feed

The point of `condition` is silence. A workflow that files something every morning is another
inbox; one that files only when a number crosses a line is the thing that lets you stop looking.
So a failed condition does not fail the run - it marks the branch SKIPPED, which is a third
outcome next to done and error and is drawn as its own colour.

Nodes read their parents' results through `{{ nodeId.path.to.value }}` templates, which is the
whole "wiring" - an edge says what may be referenced, a template says what actually is.

**A node with `for_each` runs once per item** and its output is the list of those results. That is
the fan-out in an n8n graph ("8 items" on the wire): one `get_price` node over a watchlist is
eight calls, not one.

Execution is recorded as a normal run (chat_runs + chat_tool_calls), so a workflow execution gets
the existing flow diagram and run history for free - the picture of what a workflow did and the
picture of what a chat did are the same picture, drawn by app/services/workflow.py.

The pure half - `topo_order`, `resolve`, `render` - is checked in tests/workflow_engine.selfcheck.py.
