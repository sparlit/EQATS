"""Workflows that already work, so the first one isn't a blank canvas.

A node editor is a feature people admire and don't use: the distance from "empty grid" to "thing
that helps me" is where it dies. These are graphs that do real jobs on this app's own data - clone
one, adjust it, arm it.

Two rules every template here follows, and tests/workflow_templates.selfcheck.py enforces:

1. **Every `{{ reference }}` is to a node it is wired to**, and every path matches what that tool
   actually returns. Two of the first three templates broke this - one fanned out over a field a
   list doesn't have, one gated on the reply of a tool that returns before doing its work - and
   both "ran" without complaint while doing nothing. The self-check runs each template against
   fakes shaped like the real tools, so that class of bug fails a test instead of a morning.
2. **Anything that alerts is gated.** An agent node answers with NOTHING_TO_REPORT when nothing
   qualifies, and a `not_contains` condition drops the branch. A workflow that files something
   every day is another inbox; one that files only when something happened lets you stop looking.
