"""One agent run, as a flow diagram.

The chat transcript says what the agent *concluded*; this says what it actually *did* - which
tools ran, in what order, what each one returned, and which of them ran off the same decision. It
is the n8n-style read of a run: a trigger, a chain of task nodes, a report at the end.

Pure: rows in, {nodes, edges} out. No database, no React, no layout library - which is what lets
the whole shape be checked in tests/workflow.selfcheck.py against fixtures instead of a live run.
The browser draws these with React Flow and never recomputes them, so the diagram and any future
consumer (an export, a summary) agree by construction.

**`round` is the whole trick.** The agent loop asks the model for tools, runs every tool it asked
for, feeds the results back, and asks again. Tools sharing a round were requested by ONE model
turn - they are siblings that fan out from the same decision, exactly like a split in an n8n
graph. Ordering them by `seq` alone would draw a straight line and lose that.
