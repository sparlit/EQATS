"""Agent turns that outlive the browser tab that started them.

The chat widget's own path (app/routers/chat.py) runs the agent INSIDE the streaming response, so
navigating away or closing the tab kills it mid-tool-call. That is fine for a question you are
watching and wrong for "scan my watchlist and tell me what moved", which is the kind of thing the
agent page is for.

So a run here is a row, not a request. POST starts a daemon thread and returns immediately; the
thread drives the agent loop and writes every tool call to chat_tool_calls as it happens. The
browser subscribes to an SSE feed that REPLAYS what is already stored and then follows along, so
reconnecting after a refresh - or opening the same run in a second window - shows the whole run
rather than whatever is left of it.

ponytail: the follow half polls the run's rows every POLL_SECONDS instead of a pub/sub. A run
produces a handful of tool calls over seconds-to-minutes, so this is a few cheap indexed reads,
and it has the property an in-process queue does not - a subscriber that arrives late, or after a
restart, still sees everything. Swap for LISTEN/NOTIFY if runs ever get chatty.
