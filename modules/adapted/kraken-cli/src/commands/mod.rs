/// Uniform execution: each command resolves the resources it needs from the

/// output. `#[enum_dispatch]` derives every enum-level impl from the leaf
/// impls in the submodules, so no routing match exists on this path.
///
/// Consumes the command: leaves move their parsed args into request payloads,
/// which a `&self` receiver would force to clone.
///
/// Crate-internal + static-dispatch only, so native `async fn` in a trait
/// needs no `async-trait` crate.
//
// Declared ABOVE the `mod` declarations deliberately: enum_dispatch emits each
// enum's generated impl at whichever side of the trait/enum pair expands
// second. The trait must therefore expand first, so the impls land inside the
// child modules — where the leaf types are in scope — not here.
