//! The crate's failure modes. Deliberately three-way — "you may not"
//! (`Rejected`), "your data is broken" (`Damaged`), "the machine failed"
//! (`Engine`/`Io`) — because that is the distinction consumers route on:
//! retry policy, user messaging, and the CLI's stable envelope categories
//! all map onto it one-to-one. (Plain names, not links: `Engine` only
//! exists under the `duckdb` feature, and a doc link to a gated variant
//! breaks the doc build without it.)

/// Alias for the recording layer, like `io::Result`.
