//! The recording schema's cross-cutting pieces: the version stamp, its
//! compatibility rule, and the `_meta` table. The per-channel tables are
//! defined data-driven next to their codecs (`frames::duckdb::tables`).
//!
//! Storage conventions across the channel tables: numeric columns are exact
//! `DECIMAL(38,18)` (fed as decimal strings, never floats); unsigned wire
//! ids/counts use `UBIGINT`/`UINTEGER` (lossless); timestamps stay RFC3339
//! `VARCHAR` — a microsecond `TIMESTAMP` would truncate the wire's
//! nanoseconds. `recv_ts` is the local write time; a monotonic per-frame
//! `seq` (high-water mark in `_meta.last_seq`) groups a frame's rows and
//! orders frames across reopen.
