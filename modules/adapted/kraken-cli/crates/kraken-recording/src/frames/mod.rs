//! The market-frame domain: capture contracts and storage backends.
//!
//! Extends the domain-free core with what a market capture adds on top of a
//! plain log: the finalize stamp ([`CaptureSink`]), the self-description
//! handed back before any frame decodes ([`CaptureSource`]), and the merged
//! read unit ([`MarketEvent`]). Two backends implement the pair —
//! [`jsonl`] ([`TapeSink`]/[`TapeSource`]) and the feature-gated
//! `duckdb` (plain name: a link would break the doc build without the
//! feature) — and must yield identical event sequences for one capture
//! (pinned by the backend-equivalence tests).
