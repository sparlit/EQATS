//! Cross-process advisory file locks (`std::fs::File::try_lock`, flock
//! semantics).
//!
//! Locks live on a sidecar `<path>.lock` ([`lock_path`]), never on the
//! guarded file itself: an OS lock there would collide with the engine that
//! owns it (Windows file locks are mandatory and fail the engine's I/O; on
//! unix, closing any fd drops the process's POSIX locks, so even a probe
//! could release DuckDB's own lock).
//!
//! Acquisition is fail-fast: in use means no — overlapping commands are a
//! conflict, never a queue. The kernel releases a lock the moment its holder
//! dies, so there is no stale state and no reclaim logic; liveness is probed
//! by try-locking ([`is_lock_held`]), which a recycled PID cannot spoof.
//!
//! Writers hold the lock exclusive; readers hold it shared
//! ([`FileLock::acquire_shared`]) — mutually exclusive with writers, but
//! invisible to the liveness probe and to each other. Only an exclusive
//! `Drop` unlinks the sidecar, while still holding the lock: any other
//! unlink splits the name from the held inode and breaks exclusion. A crash
//! skips the unlink; the leftover 0-byte file is inert and reads as free.
//!
//! KNOWN RACE (accepted): locks bind to inodes, unlink retires the *name*. A
//! contender that opens just before a release and locks just after holds a
//! nameless inode while the next contender locks a fresh file — two holders
//! on one resource; the same window can make [`is_lock_held`] read a live
//! holder as free. Requires microsecond interleaving; accepted over carrying
//! the fd-vs-path inode recheck that would close it (in git history if it
//! ever bites).
