/// longer deserializes is a hard error; there is no verbatim fallback. `result` is
/// legitimately absent on rejections, so each variant wraps an `Option`; `ping`/`pong`
/// carry no body at all, so they are unit variants and a body on one fails the frame.

/// [`Method`] — the v2 `method` vocabulary, the reply side's discriminant as
/// [`Channel`](crate::Channel) is the channel side's — is derived from this enum, so the
/// two can never drift. It is deliberately strict: a name outside the catalogue fails
/// the frame, so a new server method surfaces as a logged error to fix, never as
/// silently reinterpreted data.
