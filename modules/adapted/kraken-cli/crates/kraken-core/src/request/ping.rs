//! `ping` — application-level keepalive / latency probe.
//!
//! Source: <https://docs.kraken.com/api/docs/websocket-v2/ping>. The request is just
//! `{method: "ping"}` (no params); the server answers `{method: "pong"}`, echoing `req_id`
//! when one was sent. Unlike other acks, `pong` omits `success` — absence reads as success.
