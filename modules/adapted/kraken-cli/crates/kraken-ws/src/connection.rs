//! Both connection flavours over the one [`Transport`] seam, as one generic
//! [`Connection`] machine — the clients above never touch a socket directly.
//!
//! The shared mechanism is written once: dialing paced by [`Backoff`], token minting
//! through [`TokenCache`], data exchange over one events channel, drop-triggered
//! shutdown via [`CancellationToken`]. What differs is the session intent, carried by
//! the [`Mode`] value: [`Stream`] replays a fixed subscription set and reconnects
//! forever; [`OneShot`] sends one request and ends at the server's close — never
//! re-sending, since a redelivered order is a double-submit. A mode says what to put
//! on the wire at session start; what the replies *mean* stays with each client (the
//! stream types its frames only because rejection-driven routing is lifecycle policy).
