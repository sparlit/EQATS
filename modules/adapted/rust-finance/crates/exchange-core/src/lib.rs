#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Shared primitives for direct exchange connectivity.
//!
//! Everything in this crate is protocol-agnostic: the Nasdaq (ITCH/OUCH/SoupBinTCP/
//! MoldUDP64) and NYSE (XDP/Pillar) crates both decode their own wire formats into the
//! types defined here, so a single order-book engine, gap tracker and latency recorder
//! serve every venue.
//!
//! Design constraints, in priority order:
//!   1. No `unsafe`. Every wire read is bounds-checked by [`wire::Cursor`].
//!   2. No allocation on the decode hot path. Decoders borrow from the receive buffer.
//!   3. Exact arithmetic. Prices are fixed-point integers ([`price::Price`]); floats are
//!      produced only at the boundary where the rest of the system needs `f64`.
