// Deterministic Safety Gate — Zero-AI verification layer
//
// This is the "dumbest component" that is also the most critical.
// It uses ONLY deterministic math — no ML, no LLM, no agent consensus.
// Purpose: prevent confirmation bias from compounding across AI agents.
//
// Inspired by AlgoXpert's finding: removing the deterministic gate
// increased false-pass rate from 0% to 12.4%.
