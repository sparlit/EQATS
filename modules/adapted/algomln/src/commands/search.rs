//! Tauri command body for the `search_symbols` IPC.
//!
//! The fuzzy-search logic itself lives in `crate::search` and is exercised
//! directly by unit tests. This file is just the async body that pulls the
//! data the scorer needs out of `AppState` and forwards the result.
//!
//! **Lock discipline.** The body takes read guards on `symbol_map` and
//! `index_registry`, clones the data it needs into owned values, and
//! drops both guards BEFORE calling `fuzzy_search`. parking_lot's
//! `RwLockReadGuard` is `!Send` and must not be held across `.await` —
//! there is no `.await` in this function today, but the pattern keeps it
//! safe for future refactors.
