// Bundled install/script assets — embedded at compile time via include_str!.
//
// Two source trees feed into this module:
//
//   * Public install JSONs live in the public repository's
//     `docs/api/tools/install/`, which is also served at
//     echobird.ai/api/tools/install/.... The public crate's thin shell
//     constructs a [`BundledAssets`] with those `include_str!`-baked
//     strings and calls [`register`] before [`crate::run`], so this
//     crate sees them as a single `&'static` reference and never
//     touches the filesystem at runtime.
//
//   * The Mother Agent prompt/hints and the Quick-Action task scripts
//     (network-info, security-audit) are internal app behavior, NOT a
//     public API. They live INSIDE this crate under `assets/` and are
//     pulled in directly via `include_str!` below.
