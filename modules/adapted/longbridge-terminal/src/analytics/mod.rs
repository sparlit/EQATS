//! Sensors Analytics for the terminal.
//!
//! The client lives in [`core`], copied verbatim from the desktop app so fixes
//! can be moved across by replacing the file. This module holds what cannot be
//! shared: the endpoint, what this product calls itself, where the device id
//! lives, and the process-wide instance.
//!
//! ```text
//!   core.rs   wire format · HTTP · retry · identity · heartbeat · crash
//!   mod.rs    endpoint · product properties · device id · singleton
//! ```
//!
//! # Release builds only
//!
//! [`init`] does nothing in a debug build. This repository is public and there
//! is no staging project to report into, so a contributor running `cargo run`
//! would otherwise be indistinguishable from a user in every production
//! dashboard — and would be reporting their own account without ever asking to.
//! The switch is the build profile, not a flag: nothing to discover, nothing to
//! keep working across two states.
//!
//! # The three process shapes
//!
//! This binary is a short-lived CLI, a full-screen TUI, and a set of servers
//! that stay open, and analytics works differently for each:
//!
//! * **A command** (`longbridge static TSLA.US`) outlives none of its own
//!   requests. Reports run on background tasks, and `#[tokio::main]` cancels
//!   those when `main` returns — so a command **must** call [`finish_command`]
//!   (or [`flush`]) before exiting, or its events are simply never sent. There
//!   is nothing in the log to indicate this: the failure is a request that was
//!   never made.
//! * **The TUI** runs long enough to report normally, and beats.
//! * **A session** (`ai`, `serve`, `acp`) also stays open and beats, but is
//!   routinely killed rather than exited, which is why its run event goes out on
//!   the way in. Counted as a command it would have looked like the fastest
//!   thing in the product while actually being the longest.
//!
//! All three are configured from [`init`], which takes the shape as an argument
//! rather than guessing. [`Shape`] owns every consequence of the distinction —
//! whether it beats, when the run event fires, which crash file it claims — so
//! adding a shape does not mean finding the places that switch on it.
//!
//! # When the run event is sent
//!
//! One [`event::COMMAND`] per invocation, but at different moments depending on
//! how the command ends:
//!
//! * **One-shot commands** report on the way out, from [`finish_command`], so
//!   the event carries the outcome and how long the run took. Reporting on the
//!   way in would cost a round trip less — the request would overlap the
//!   command's own work — but it cannot say whether the user got an answer,
//!   which is the question the data exists to answer.
//! * **Sessions** (`ai`, `serve`, `acp`) report on the way in, through
//!   [`report_started`]. These are routinely killed rather than exited, and an
//!   exit-time event for a process that ends on Ctrl-C never arrives at all.
//!
//! `tui` reports neither: it has [`event::TUI_LAUNCH`] of its own, and counting
//! it as a command as well would double every total.
//!
//! # What is lost, knowingly
//!
//! [`core`]'s retry queue lives in memory, so a report that fails while a
//! one-shot command is exiting is gone — a command's whole life is shorter than
//! one retry. Persisting it would mean the next run carrying the last one's
//! backlog, which is a change to the shared file rather than to this one.
//! Offline use therefore reports nothing at all, and the numbers should be read
//! as "runs that reached the ingest", not "runs".

// Shared with the desktop app, so its lints are waived here rather than fixed in
// place: editing the file would cost the ability to sync a fix by replacing it
// wholesale, which is the only reason it is a copy at all. Not byte-identical
// though — this project requires `cargo fmt`, which reformats it — so syncing is
// "copy the file, run `cargo fmt`", and the diff that leaves behind is
// formatting only.
