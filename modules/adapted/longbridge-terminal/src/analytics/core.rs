//! Sensors Analytics from Rust — a self-contained client.
//!
//! # Copying this into another project
//!
//! This file has no dependencies on the rest of this repository. Drop it in,
//! declare the crates below, and it works. Everything project-specific —
//! endpoint, device id, platform naming, product identifier — arrives through
//! [`Config`], so nothing here needs editing.
//!
//! ```toml
//! reqwest    = { version = "0.12", default-features = false, features = ["rustls-tls"] }
//! serde_json = "1"
//! base64     = "0.22"
//! uuid       = { version = "1", features = ["v4"] }
//! log        = "0.4"
//! tokio      = { version = "1", features = ["time"] }
//! ```
//!
//! To run this file's own tests, tokio additionally needs `["macros", "rt"]`.
//!
//! In a Tauri app, enable the `tauri-runtime` feature:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [features]
//! default = ["tauri-runtime"]
//! tauri-runtime = []
//! ```
//!
//! Without it, background work goes through `tokio::spawn`, which needs an
//! ambient Tokio runtime. Tauri's `setup()` does not run inside one, so a Tauri
//! host that skips the feature gets a warning and **no background work at all**
//! — no requests, no heartbeat. It will not crash, but it will report nothing.
//!
//! # Setting it up
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let sensors = Sensors::new(Config {
//!     // Required — the client cannot guess any of these.
//!     server_url: "https://event-tracking.example.com/sa?project=production".into(),
//!     device_id: stable_machine_id(),          // survives restarts
//!     lib_name: "Rust".into(),                 // name YOUR client, see Config::lib_name
//!     lib_version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into(),
//!     base_properties: properties,             // platform, product, app version, env
//!
//!     // Optional — omit to disable.
//!     heartbeat: Some(Heartbeat {
//!         event: "app_heartbeat".into(),
//!         ..Default::default()                 // every 60s, only while active
//!     }),
//!     crash: Some(Crash {
//!         path: data_dir.join("last-crash.json"),
//!         event: "app_crash".into(),
//!     }),
//!     ..Config::default()
//! })?;
//! ```
//!
//! Then wire the host to it. **Each of these is a feature that silently does
//! nothing if skipped**, which is why they are listed rather than left to be
//! discovered:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // 1. Report events. Before the identity is known these are held, not sent.
//! sensors.track("app_launch", json!({ "channel": channel }));
//!
//! // 2. Identity. Required for events to reach the account — see the note
//! //    below. Call on every session change; `None` means signed out, and is
//! //    what releases held events for a guest.
//! sensors.set_member(Some(member_id));
//!
//! // 3. Activity, from window focus/blur. Without it every session looks
//! //    unbroken, and an app left open overnight reads as an all-night session.
//! sensors.set_active(focused);
//!
//! // 4. Crashes. Chain the previous hook — replacing it takes the panic
//! //    message off stderr, where anyone debugging looks first.
//! let previous = std::panic::take_hook();
//! let reporter = sensors.clone();
//! std::panic::set_hook(Box::new(move |info| {
//!     reporter.note_crash(&info.to_string());
//!     previous(info);
//! }));
//!
//! // 5. SHORT-LIVED PROCESSES ONLY — a CLI, a one-shot command. Reports run on
//! //    background tasks, and `#[tokio::main]` cancels those when `main`
//! //    returns, so without this most events never leave. Nothing appears in
//! //    the log either: the failure is a request that was never made.
//! sensors.flush(Duration::from_secs(3)).await;
//! ```
//!
//! A long-running app (GUI, daemon, TUI) does not need step 5 — it outlives its
//! own requests. A CLI needs nothing *but* steps 1 and 5.
//!
//! # What it sends
//!
//! Every event carries `base_properties` plus whatever is passed to `track`.
//! The two built-in events add:
//!
//! | event       | properties                                                    |
//! |-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | heartbeat   | `active`, `interval_ms`, `uptime_ms`, `active_ms`             |
//! | crash       | `recovered`, `crashed_at`, `crashed_after_ms`, `crashed_after_active_ms`, `info` |
//!
//! `active_ms` is time the host reported as active, accumulated across focus
//! changes — not inferred from beat counts, so a burst shorter than one
//! interval still counts.
//!
//! # Hosting a WebView that also runs the JS SDK
//!
//! Call [`seed_script`] and inject the result before any page script. Without
//! it the SDK mints its own anonymous id, and the two halves report as two
//! different users — visible only as roughly doubled user counts, never as an
//! error. The host must also configure the SDK with `cross_subdomain: false`;
//! see that function's documentation.
//!
//! # Why the wire format is hand-written
//!
//! Sensors publishes no Rust SDK. This reproduces what the JavaScript SDK
//! (`sa-sdk-javascript` 1.21.13) puts on the wire, which is:
//!
//! ```text
//! POST <server_url>            Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
//! data=<urlencode(base64(json))>&ext=<urlencode("crc=" + hash(base64))>
//! ```
//!
//! Three details are easy to get wrong from memory and are pinned by tests:
//! nothing is compressed (the SDK has no gzip path at all); the checksum is
//! computed over the **base64 text**, not the JSON; and `_track_id` /
//! `_flush_time` are not optional — the SDK adds both unconditionally.
//!
//! # Two things learned the hard way
//!
//! **Events must carry the member id.** Reporting under a device id alone and
//! expecting the browser SDK's `$SignUp` to associate the two does not work on
//! a client that was already signed in when analytics shipped: that event is
//! only emitted when the member id *changes*. Identical payloads differing only
//! in `distinct_id` were measured landing or vanishing accordingly.
//!
//! **The first events happen before the identity is known.** A launch event
//! fires before any UI exists, so sending it immediately pins the most useful
//! event in the product to an anonymous id forever. [`Sensors::track`] holds
//! events until [`Sensors::set_member`] is called or the wait expires.
