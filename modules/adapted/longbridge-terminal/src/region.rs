// one is accepted by the other. A server response containing the other region's
// host is therefore valid and must not be rewritten client-side.
//
// They differ in one respect: `.com` reaches both data centers, while `.cn` has
// no path to US and can only authorize AP accounts. That restriction is enforced
// server-side (the `.cn` login page does not offer US accounts), so nothing here
// or in `auth` needs to account for it. Always logging in through `.com` is not
// an alternative — China Mainland networks may be unable to reach it, which is
// why `.cn` exists.
//
// Two separate concepts, easily confused:
//   - Access point (`.cn` / `.com`) — this module, network routing.
//   - Data center (`ap` / `us`)     — the `x-dc-region` header, selects the
//     account's data center and determines which US-only APIs are available.
//
// The two are not freely combinable. A credential's prefix (`us_…` / `ap_…`,
// see `longbridge::DcRegion::from_credential`) fixes which access points can
// serve it:
//
//   | Data center | `.com`                             | `.cn` |
//   |-------------|------------------------------------|-------|
//   | `us`        | yes — the only usable access point | no    |
//   | `ap`        | yes                                | yes   |
//
// `.cn` has no path to the US data center. This is a hard constraint, not a
// latency preference: a US token sent to `.cn` still authenticates, and basic
// calls such as `static_info` succeed, but every market-data request comes back
// `301604 no quote access` because `.cn` cannot source US-account quotes. The
// error reads like a missing permission and is not one.
//
// So a US-data-center token must be pinned to the global endpoints regardless
// of where the client sits — see the `token_dc_is_us` guard in
// `openapi::init_contexts`, which keeps US tokens off the CN branch even when
// the cached geotest says China Mainland. AP tokens take the nearer access
// point, since both serve them.
