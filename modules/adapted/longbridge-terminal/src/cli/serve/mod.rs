//! `longbridge serve` — a long-lived JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for third-party
//! clients (desktop widgets, bar plugins, scripts).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Without it, a client polls by spawning `longbridge <cmd> --format json` on a
//! timer. Every spawn re-does region detection, token load, WebSocket connect,
//! one request, exit — so the cost dominates, and the client is stuck at
//! poll-interval latency with no way to see a tick.
//!
//! `serve` pays that cost once and keeps the connection. Quotes then arrive as
//! server-initiated notifications at WebSocket speed.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! Newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio: one compact JSON object per
//! line. This is the base protocol LSP, MCP and ACP share, so a client needs
//! only a JSON parser and a line splitter — no protocol library.
//!
//! Requests are handled concurrently: a slow `trade.stock_positions` must not
//! stall the quote feed, so each one runs in its own task and every writer
//! funnels through a single channel that owns stdout. Responses may therefore
//! arrive out of order — correlate them by `id`, as JSON-RPC intends.
//! [`MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`] bounds how much of that reaches Longbridge.
//!
//! ```text
//! → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"quote.quote","params":{"symbols":["700.HK"]}}
//! ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[{"symbol":"700.HK","last_done":"320.000",...}]}
//! → {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"quote.subscribe","params":{"symbols":["700.HK"]}}
//! ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{"subscribed":[{"symbol":"700.HK","fields":["quote"]}]}}
//! ← {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"quote.updated","params":{"symbol":"700.HK","last_done":"320.200",...}}
//! ```
//!
//! See [`methods`] for where the method surface comes from and why its payloads
//! are the raw upstream shapes rather than the CLI's `--format json` output.
