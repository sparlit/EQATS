//! Printing that survives a reader walking away.
//!
//! `longbridge kline 700.HK --count 1000 | head -1` leaves the CLI writing into
//! a pipe nobody is reading. Rust ignores `SIGPIPE` for the whole process, so
//! that write fails with `EPIPE` rather than killing us — and `println!` turns
//! the failure into a panic. Under this crate's `panic = "abort"` release
//! profile that panic is a `SIGABRT` and a core dump, for what is an ordinary
//! way to end a pipeline.
//!
//! The `print!` / `println!` / `eprint!` / `eprintln!` macros defined at the
//! crate root shadow the prelude ones and route every call site here, where a
//! closed reader ends the run quietly instead.
//!
//! Restoring `SIGPIPE` to `SIG_DFL` is the other common fix, and was rejected:
//! this binary holds long-lived WebSocket and HTTP connections, and `std`'s
//! vectored socket writes go through `writev` without `MSG_NOSIGNAL`, so the
//! default disposition would trade a stdout panic for the process being killed
//! mid-session by a peer reset.
