//! The order-execution gate.
//!
//! Every command that can move real money — `order buy/sell/cancel/replace`
//! and `grid submit/replace/cancel/suspend/restart` — previews by default and
//! acts only when the caller passes `--execute <CODE>`, quoting the three-digit
//! code the preview printed.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Stopping the ordinary mistake: acting on an order nobody previewed, or on a
//! *different* order than the one previewed. Change the price after reading the
//! code and it stops matching — the user approved one order and a different one
//! was about to be sent, which is the case worth catching.
//!
//! It is not a secret, and is not meant to be. The arguments are the caller's
//! own and this file is public, so anyone set on skipping the preview can
//! compute a code instead of asking for one. Nor does it prove a *human* saw
//! the preview: a caller can dry-run, read the code and execute in one breath.
//! Enforcing human review needs a control outside this process, such as a
//! harness approval hook or account-level trade confirmation.
//!
//! # Derived, not stored
//!
//! The code is three digits off a digest of the canonicalised arguments, and
//! nothing else — no clock, no file, no per-run value. Storing a pending code
//! instead would buy single use, and cost a list of ways to fail that have
//! nothing to do with the order: previewing twice would strand the first code,
//! an unwritable home directory would break the gate, and a code would die
//! while the user was still deciding.
//!
//! # Tolerant on purpose
//!
//! Inputs are canonicalised before hashing, so a code survives the harmless
//! rewordings between the two runs: `400` and `400.00` are the same price,
//! `buy` and `Buy` the same side, `700.hk` and `700.HK` the same symbol. A
//! confirmation that fails on a difference the user cannot see is worse than no
//! confirmation at all — it teaches people to distrust the gate.
