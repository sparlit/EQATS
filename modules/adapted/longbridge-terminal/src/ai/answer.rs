//! The shape of a `LongbridgeAI` answer.
//!
//! An answer is Markdown with three things of the agent's own mixed in:
//! ```` ```vis-chart ```` specs, `widget://…` references, and `[stock …]` /
//! `[citation N]` inline markers. This module is the one place that knows how to
//! take an answer apart; both the `ai` TUI and `agent chat`'s stdout renderer
//! consume the result rather than each re-scanning the text.
//!
//! The authority on what the agent may emit is the server's allowlist
//! (`portai/backend/config/default/mcp_resources.yaml`), which is what fills the
//! `{widget_templates}` slot in its prompt — not the web client's `COMPONENTS_MAP`
//! registry, which both lacks kinds the model is offered (`trade/order/*`) and
//! keeps kinds no server serves. Where the two disagree, follow the allowlist:
//! anything the model can emit has to render as something.
