//! Liveness of the server connections, as the reference checks it (ibx#419).
//!
//! Auth connection: a monitor polled once a second. Every send on the link
//! starts a pause of 60 s during which the monitor checks nothing. Outside
//! the pause, in this order:
//! 1. when the receive silence grew by more than ten polls since the last
//!    check (the process was asleep), the counters are reset and nothing
//!    else is done;
//! 2. receive silence over 35 s: the link is dead;
//! 3. send silence of 10 s: a heartbeat is sent (else, receive silence of
//!    11 s is logged);
//! 4. receive silence of 15 s and no test request waiting: a test request
//!    is sent.
//!
//! Since these sends start a new pause, and the server asks for an answer
//! after about 20 s of silence, the monitor normally never runs while the
//! server is alive. A silent server is found at the first check after the
//! pause, about 62 s after the last send.
//!
//! Farms (market data and historical): a test request every 60 s from the
//! logon; the link is dead when nothing at all arrives within 10 s of it.
//! There is no other own heartbeat on a farm: the server's test requests
//! are answered, and that is all.
