//! The market data steps of each farm message, queued from the engine to
//! the API client (ibx#446).
//!
//! The reference sends the ticks of a market data request while it decodes
//! each server message, one step at a time, with that message's values:
//! the daily figures and each trade (its time, its exchange, then its price
//! and size) in the order of the message, then each book update
//! (`jmdclient.bl.a(...)`, the record notifications of `jclient.record.A`).
//! Its API socket buffers what the client has not read yet, so a client
//! that reads slower than the messages come still gets every step, never
//! two messages merged into one.
//!
//! ibx's engine writes each step as an [`MdEvent`] into [`MdQueue`], a ring
//! the API client's dispatch reads: one writer (the engine's thread), one
//! reader (the dispatch, under the client's lock), fixed size, no lock and
//! no allocation. A message's steps are written as its blocks are read and
//! handed over together at its end; the first one is marked, so that the
//! reader takes the book updates after the message's other steps, as the
//! reference applies them. The quote snapshot of the engine API
//! (`MarketDataState::quote`) is kept as before, apart from this queue.
//!
//! A full ring: the reference's buffer has no limit, but ibx's engine loop
//! can neither wait for the client nor grow without bound. The steps of an
//! instrument that do not fit are dropped, and as soon as the ring is at
//! most half full the engine writes one catch-up step with the instrument's
//! whole quote (`MdStep::CatchUp`): the client sends what changed since its
//! last step, in one step. The intermediate values of that instrument are
//! lost; its last values are not, and nothing else is.
