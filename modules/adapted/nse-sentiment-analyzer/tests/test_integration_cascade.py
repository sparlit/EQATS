"""
Integration tests for the cascade detection pipeline (cascade.py).

Unlike tests/test_cascade.py — which exercises detect_cascade() with minimal,
single-purpose fixtures — these tests feed in news items shaped like the
output of data_fetcher.fetch_market_headlines() (title/body/source/date/url)
and assert on the full, realistic result: the right drivers fire, the right
tickers are attached, and the Bullish/Bearish semantics are correct end to end.

No mocking is required: detect_cascade() is a pure transformation over the
news list plus the static CASCADE_MAP, so realistic-shaped dicts are enough.
