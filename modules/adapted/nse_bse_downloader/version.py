# Verified update artifacts, keyed by "<platform>-<architecture>" exactly as
# package_release_artifact.py names each release archive.  Release automation
# fills one entry per published asset, with the URL and its SHA-256 written
# together.
#
# The updater stays notification-only for any platform with no entry, an empty
# URL, or an empty digest, rather than executing code without an integrity
# check.  An empty mapping therefore makes every platform notification-only,
# which is the intended state until a release is published.
#
# Do not rename __version__, __build_date__ or VERSION_HISTORY.  Installed
# v1.0.1 clients parse those three by regular expression to discover this
# release, and tests/test_index_and_version.py fails if that contract breaks.
