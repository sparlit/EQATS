"""Publish symbol histories out of the EOD database.

Step 3 of Phase 5.  Step 2 proved the database can reproduce every published
file byte for byte; this is what that proof buys.

The gain is **not** that generating a file from the database is faster.  It is
measurably slower: rebuilding all 8,124 histories of the owner's tree takes
10.27 s against 5.48 s to read and parse the existing ones.  The gain is that
most of the work does not have to happen at all.

Adding one trading day rewrites every touched history in full.  On a four-date
tree that is 3.65 MB written to add 0.71 MB of new rows -- **5.1x** -- and the
ratio is the number of dates, so a multi-year archive rewrites gigabytes to
add a megabyte.  A history whose only change is rows after its last stored date
can instead be **appended to**, which is O(the new rows) rather than O(the
whole history.)

That is possible only because of what step 2 measured: a row's spelling comes
from the frame its own date published, not from the column it sits in.  Checked
against all 8,124 real histories, a row rendered on its own is byte-identical
to its line in the file -- every one of them.  Had spelling been a property of
the column, appending could not have produced the same bytes and this step
would have had no cheap path at all.
