"""SQLite storage for end-of-day rows, written beside the published text files.

This is step 1 of Phase 5 in
[CODE_DEFECT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](../../docs/engineering/CODE_DEFECT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md):
*dual-write*.  Rows are inserted from the same canonical frames the text files
are written from, in the same transaction-per-date shape the rest of the
pipeline already uses, and **nothing reads this database yet**.  Publication,
symbol histories, rebuilds and corporate actions all still run entirely off the
text files, so the store can be deleted at any time with no loss and the whole
step is revertible by turning one setting off.

Why a separate database file from ``pipeline_state.sqlite3``:

* That store is bookkeeping -- two small tables and a history journal -- and it
  runs ``PRAGMA integrity_check`` on every open.  This table grows to millions
  of rows, and checking it on every application start would make startup scale
  with the size of the archive.
* The two have different lifecycles.  ``.state`` bookkeeping is disposable; this
  is the thing Phase 5 exists to make authoritative.
* Its schema version can move without touching a store whose strict version
  check guards the resume logic.

    The copy-and-open approach is the one `ReadOnlyPipelineStore` already
    proved necessary here, for a reason found by measuring rather than by
    reading the documentation: SQLite's ``mode=ro`` still creates and stamps
    the ``-shm`` file, because a WAL database needs its shared-memory index.
    The ``-wal`` file is copied after the main file, in that order, because in
    WAL mode the main file only changes during a checkpoint; ``-shm`` is
    deliberately not copied, since SQLite rebuilds it and a stale one is worse
