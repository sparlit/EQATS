"""One writer per data root.

Two copies of the application pointed at the same tree destroy each other's
work silently.  Both read a symbol history, both append their own day, and the
one that writes second replaces the file the first just wrote; the registry and
the corporate-action ledger lose entries the same way.  Nothing in the run
reports it, because each process did exactly what it was asked.

The lock is an advisory whole-file lock held for the lifetime of the process
and keyed on the resolved data root -- the lock file lives inside it, so two
copies configured with different roots never contend, and two paths that reach
one root through a symlink share one inode and therefore one lock.
