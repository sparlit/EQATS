"""Track which adjustment semantics produced each exchange's symbol files.

A corporate-action correction cannot reach bars that were already adjusted:
the action is recorded ``applied`` and is never divided a second time.  So a
symbol file written by an older build keeps the older arithmetic for its old
bars while new bars use the new one, and nothing on disk says which is which.

This marker says which, per exchange, so the application can tell the user that
a rebuild is what adopts the new arithmetic.
