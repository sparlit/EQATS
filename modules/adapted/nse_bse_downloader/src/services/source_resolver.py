#: (``SCRIP ID``/``SC_GROUP``/``TRADING_DATE``) and 2023-01-02 is already UDiFF

#: Earliest date each segment has an official report for.  A segment is not a
#: missing dependency before this date -- it never existed -- so a combined file
#: must still publish rather than waiting forever for a component the exchange
#: never produced.  It is also the floor every download clamps to, and the
#: earliest date the date picker offers.  Segments absent from this mapping
#: have no known floor, which is not the same as an early one: a caller must
#: keep its own default rather than assume.
#:
#: Pinned against the archives on 2026-08-20 the same way the delivery floors
#: were -- the date itself downloads and the previous weekday does not:
#:
#: * NSE EQ 1994-11-03, which is the exchange's own first trading day;
#: * NSE FO 2000-06-12, the day index futures launched;
#: * NSE INDEX 2012-02-21;
#: * NSE SME 2012-09-18, shortly after the Emerge platform opened.
#:
#: BSE EQ is deliberately absent, and not for want of measuring. Its archive
#: is not contiguous, so no single date describes it. Five attempts per date
#: on 2026-08-20:
#:
#: * 2016-12-08, 12-09 and 12-12 each served a complete bhavcopy of roughly
#:   2,900 rows, five times out of five;
#: * 2016-12-13 served nothing, five times out of five -- and it is a trading
#:   day, not a holiday in the bundled 2016 calendar, whose only December
#:   entry is the 25th;
#: * 2017-03-15, 2019-07-10 and 2021-04-08 served complete bhavcopies again;
#: * 2006-01-02, 2010-06-15, 2013-02-11, 2015-06-10, 2016-06-10 and every
#:   sampled day of November and early December 2016 served nothing.
#:
#: So the boundary a binary search converges on is the edge of a hole rather
#: than the start of the archive. A floor stops the application from even
#: trying earlier dates, which puts real data permanently out of reach if it
#: is wrong; leaving the segment unbounded only costs some doomed requests at
#: the start of a backfill, and the absent-report ledger settles each of them
#: once. Worth revisiting only with evidence of a contiguous start.
