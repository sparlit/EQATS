Step 2 of Phase 5 in
[CODE_DEFECT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](../../docs/engineering/CODE_DEFECT_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md):
prove that the database holds everything the text files hold, by writing the
files back out of it and diffing them byte for byte against what the run
published.  Nothing here is wired into publication -- step 3 does that, and
only once this has held for a release.

The exporter deliberately does **not** format numbers itself.  It rebuilds the
frame and hands it to ``DataFrame.to_csv`` with the same arguments the
publisher uses, because the published text is whatever pandas made of that
frame and the surest way to reproduce it is to reproduce the frame.  That
turns byte parity into a question about *dtypes*, which is a question with a
finite answer, instead of a question about float repr, which is not.
