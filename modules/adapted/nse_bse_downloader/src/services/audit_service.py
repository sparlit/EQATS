"""Read-only verification of a published NSE/BSE data root.

The database this application builds is meant to accumulate for years and be
traded off.  Until now "is it complete and self-consistent?" could not be
answered without changing it: every sha256 written into the pipeline manifest
was never read back, and the only repair tooling was the destructive
``--rebuild-*``.

This module answers that question and changes nothing.  "Changes nothing" is a
requirement, not a courtesy -- a report produced by code that had just written
to the database would not be evidence about the database the user has -- so
none of the ordinary routes into the data root are used here:

* ``Config.get_data_path`` creates the folder it is asked about, so
  ``Config.resolve_data_path`` is used instead;
* ``DataManager.__init__`` creates the whole folder structure, so the published
  filename contract is imported from ``DAILY_FILE_PATTERNS`` directly;
* ``PipelineManifest`` initialises its SQLite schema and imports the legacy
  JSON in its constructor, so ``ReadOnlyPipelineStore`` is used instead;
* ``VersionedJSONStore.read`` and ``read_internal_snapshot`` copy a file they
  cannot parse into ``.state/quarantine``, so neither is called.  A file this
  command cannot parse is reported, not moved.
