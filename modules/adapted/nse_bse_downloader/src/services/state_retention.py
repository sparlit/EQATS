"""Bounded retention for the diagnostic copies kept under ``.state``.

Three subtrees exist purely so a human can look at what went wrong after the
fact, and none of them is read by the application:

* ``quarantine`` -- bytes that failed validation, kept instead of being
  overwritten so a run can fail closed without destroying the evidence;
* ``raw_revisions`` -- the previous contents of a raw snapshot the exchange
  later republished with different bytes;
* ``backups/history`` -- a full copy of every symbol file, written before
  every symbol write until v1.1.0 removed it.

All three grow without limit, and the last one is written by nothing now, so
retention is what keeps a long backfill from leaving a permanent second copy
of the database behind.  ``.state/raw``, the checksummed rebuild source the
``--rebuild-*`` commands read, is deliberately not one of them.

Housekeeping must never be able to fail a run: every path here reports what it
could not do rather than raising, and the caller decides how loudly to say so.
