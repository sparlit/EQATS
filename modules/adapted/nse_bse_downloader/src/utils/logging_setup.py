"""Where the application's diagnostics go, and what they say.

Until this existed there was no logging configuration anywhere, so a packaged
build produced nothing a user could send: every ``logger.info`` went to a
handler that was never installed, and only Python's last-resort handler put
warnings on a console a windowed application does not have.  Diagnosing the
v1.1.1 certificate defect meant running the packaged binary from a terminal to
capture stderr, which is not something a user can be asked to do.

Logs are written under the per-user state directory, never under the data root:
the data root holds years of downloaded market history, and a log file has no
business growing inside it.
