"""
Operator controls (plan M9.3; audit §L.4, §N.1 #1): halt, resume and flatten the books' global
kill switches, each recorded as a ``ControlCommand`` event whether or not it changed anything.

With a run in this process the engine's own :class:`KillSwitchRegistry` objects are used, so the
RiskGate sees the change on its next check. Without one, the switches' persisted state in the
store is changed directly (the web server holds the environment's process lock, so no other
engine can be running on it); the next session starts with it.
