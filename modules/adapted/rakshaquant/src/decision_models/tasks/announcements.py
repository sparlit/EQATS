"""
The announcement classifier (plan M7.7): every new ``AnnouncementReceived`` becomes a
``TypedEvent`` (projected into ``typed_events``) for the event gate (M7.8) and Book B (M7.9).

* **State** - built only from the public announcement (company, the exchange's subject, the
  text, cut to fit the checkpoint's context): :func:`announcement_state` takes an
  ``AnnouncementReceived`` and nothing else, so no portfolio data can reach a decision model.
* **Questions** - ``relevant`` (noul), ``event_type`` (12-way choice), ``direction`` (4-way
  choice), ``materiality`` (score: minor < moderate < major), answered by the Laya→Jev cascade.
* **Exchange categories first** - where NSE's own ``SUBJECT`` is unambiguous (financial results,
  a board meeting to consider results, dividend, split/bonus, pledge, insider trading) it sets
  the event type deterministically (``extra.type_source = "exchange_subject"``), because the
  event gate must not depend on an uncalibrated model to see a results date. The model still
  answers direction and materiality, and the type of everything else.
* **Dates** - the date a scheduled event happens (the board meeting that considers results) is
  extracted from the text deterministically into ``extra.event_date``.
* A question the cascade abstains on stays ``None`` (unknown), never a guess.
