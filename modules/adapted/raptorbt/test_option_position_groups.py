"""Sold options that hedge each other are margined as one group (0.12.1).

In plain words: a sold call and a sold put on the same underlying and
expiry cannot both lose at once, and an exchange charges the pair much less
than two separate deposits. Since 0.12.1 the portfolio session re-prices
sold legs that share an underlying and expiry as one group once they are
open together, so a hedged book keeps more capital free and is not
margin-called at a level only two naked deposits would have breached.
