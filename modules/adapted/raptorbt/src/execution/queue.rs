//! Queue-position model for resting limit fills.
//!
//! The default fill model draws a Bernoulli per marketable limit
//! (`fill_prob_limit`), which has two defects: it has no memory, so an order
//! passed over four times is no likelier to fill on the fifth; and it
//! ignores the tape, so a one-lot print and a ten-thousand-lot print at the
//! same price count the same.
//!
//! This model fixes both with the only evidence a market-by-price feed
//! actually provides. It estimates the size queued ahead **once**, when the
//! order first rests, and then consumes that estimate with observed print
//! volume at the order's price. Progress is monotone: volume that trades
//! ahead of you never un-trades.
//!
//! What it deliberately does **not** claim: a real queue rank. Without an
//! order-by-order feed there is no way to know you are third of eleven, nor
//! to tell size that executed ahead of you from size that was cancelled.
//! Both are well-known limits of market-by-price data, and pretending
//! otherwise would be fiction dressed as precision.
