// Six defects lived here, and no test in this file ever called `run()` -- the
// whole accounting path was unpinned, which is how they accumulated. Fees
// ignored the lot multiplier while P&L honored it; the entry charge was
// dropped from both the trade record and the P&L; exits were priced with the
// buy-side schedule; `total_fees_paid` read zero; `size` reported lots; and
// the end-of-data close was never paid for out of the equity curve.
//
// One lot of 50 at a premium of 100 is a 5000 notional, so a 0.1% rate is
// 5.00 per side and 10.00 for the round trip. Every figure below is derived
// from that, deliberately absolute rather than self-consistent.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// moving. Enters at bar 1 and exits on signal at bar 4 unless `hold` is set,
/// in which case the position is left open and closes at end of data.
