"""Live tick stream for class-based strategies.

The batch runners replay a finished dataset; this drives the same session,
kernels and strategy hooks from events pushed one at a time — an open-ended
feed whose end is not known in advance. Push a tick, and every hook it
triggers fires before ``push_tick`` returns, so the caller reads positions
and queued state synchronously.

Semantics are identical to :func:`raptorbt.run_tick_strategy` — both drive
the same dispatch loop — with two additions. Pushed or warmup *bars* execute
(they match orders and mark equity), exactly as in the bar runner; bars
aggregated from prints via ``primary_bars`` remain a view only. And a print
the session refuses (``ltp == 0`` and no two-sided book — an index that has
not ticked, a quote-only row) still advances that symbol's clock: alerts
and timers due by its timestamp fire inside that push, instead of waiting
for the next accepted print. The batch runner never sees such rows, so it
cannot fire on them; feed it rows that carry a price.

Typical shape::

    stream = TickStrategyStream(
        MyStrategy(), ["NSE:TCS"], warmup_bars={"NSE:TCS": bars},
        primary_bars=(1, "m"),
    )
    for tick in feed:                      # days-long, open-ended
        stream.push_tick("NSE:TCS", tick.ts_ns, tick.ltp, tick.bid, tick.ask)
    result = stream.finish()               # once the session truly ends

    strategy during construction, so indicators are primed before the first
    live push. Warmup bars execute; hand the stream a strategy that stays
    passive on history if that is not wanted.

    ``initial_positions`` maps symbol -> ``{"quantity", "avg_price",
    "timestamp_ns"?}`` and ADOPTS a position the account already holds
    (broker-truth seeding): the strategy starts knowing it is long that many
    units at that average cost, with no order, no fill, no fees and no trade
    record. Adoption happens before warmup replay and before the first push,
    so the position appears in every snapshot from the start — a caller
    diffing ``positions()`` before/after pushes will never see it as a fresh
    entry. Cash or fully funded margin accounts (``leverage=1.0``), long-only;
    refused (never skipped) otherwise. Fully funded margin is supported
    because a strategy holding a short must run under a margin account for
    that short to transact at all, and such a book still needs seeding.
