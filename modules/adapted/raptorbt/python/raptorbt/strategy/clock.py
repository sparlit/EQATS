"""Bar-driven simulation clock: one-shot alerts and recurring timers.

In a multi-symbol run each symbol gets its own clock, so a timer set in
``on_start`` fires once per symbol rather than once for whichever symbol's
event happened to cross the threshold first. ``ctx.clock`` is the clock of
``ctx.symbol``; alerts and timers set from a handler therefore belong to
the symbol being handled.


Time events fire when a bar's timestamp reaches the scheduled time — at bar
granularity, which is why events carry both ``ts_scheduled`` and
``ts_fired`` (the bar timestamp that triggered them). Events dispatch to
``on_time_event`` *before* the bar's own data handlers: scheduled time
precedes the bar that revealed it had passed.
