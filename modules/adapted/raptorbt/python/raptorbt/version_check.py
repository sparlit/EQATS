"""
Tells you, once a day, when the installed raptorbt is behind the newest release.

Plain words: this module asks pypi.org what the latest published version of
raptorbt is, compares it to the one you have, and writes a single log line if
yours is older. That is all it does. It never changes how the engine behaves,
never raises, and never delays your program.

Four properties are load-bearing, because this runs on the import path of a
production trading service:

1. **It cannot block.** The network call happens on a daemon thread. `import
   raptorbt` returns at once whether or not pypi.org answers, and a hung
   socket cannot keep the process alive at shutdown.
2. **It cannot fail.** Every path is wrapped. No DNS, a proxy, a firewall, a
   read-only cache directory, or a malformed response all end the same way --
   silence.
3. **It cannot spam.** The answer is cached on disk for a day, so a fleet of
   services restarting does not mean a burst of requests, and a busy process
   checks once per interpreter regardless.
4. **It can be turned off.** Set RAPTORBT_NO_VERSION_CHECK=1 and no socket is
   ever opened. Continuous-integration environments are skipped automatically.

The comparison is deliberately conservative: anything it cannot parse with
certainty is treated as "not behind", so a version scheme this code does not
understand produces no message rather than a wrong one.
