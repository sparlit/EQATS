//! The structure under test throughout is a **calendar spread**: sell an
//! option expiring soon, buy one expiring later at the same strike. The
//! whole trade is the gap between the two expiries -- the near leg dies and
//! the far leg keeps living. Through 0.7.4 the engine closed both the moment
