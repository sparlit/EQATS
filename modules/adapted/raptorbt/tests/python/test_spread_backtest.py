"""Behavior tests for the spread backtest surface, against the built wheel.

``run_spread_backtest`` shipped a sign error through 0.6.3: it returned a
``pnl`` that was the negative of the truth, so a multi-leg options structure
that made money was reported as a loss. Worse, the ``max_loss`` and
``target_profit`` thresholds compare against the same figure, so a stop closed
positions that had GAINED and a target booked wins on positions that had LOST.

The defect survived because nothing tested it. The Rust unit tests asserted
only that a trade was recorded, and this Python suite -- the one CI runs
against the real wheel -- did not call ``run_spread_backtest`` at all. These
tests close that gap at the boundary the defect actually crossed.

Fees are left at the default, so P&L assertions carry a tolerance; the sign
and the magnitude-to-the-rupee are what matter, not the last few paise.
