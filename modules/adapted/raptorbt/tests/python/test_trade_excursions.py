"""MAE and MFE, exercised through the wheel.

In plain words: how far a trade went against you before it worked, and how
far in your favour before it failed. Without these two numbers a losing
strategy cannot be told apart from a winning one that was stopped too early
-- both report the same realised loss, and only the excursion says which it
was.

They are MEASURED, bar by bar, while the position is open -- not inferred
afterwards from an OHLC window. That distinction is the reason they live in
the engine: reconstructing them later cannot know whether the high or the
low came first within a bar, so a reconstructed "the stop was hit before the
target" is a coin flip. What the engine reports is bounded by the bar's own
resolution -- a 5m run knows the worst 5m extreme, not the worst tick inside
it -- and no finer claim is made anywhere.

`None` means the path never tracked extremes (a synthesised spread or basket
leg), never a zero excursion.
