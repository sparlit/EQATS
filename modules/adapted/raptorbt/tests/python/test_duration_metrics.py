"""Duration metrics, exercised through the wheel.

A bar is not a unit of time. On daily data one bar is one day, so counting
bars and calling the answer "days" was right by accident. On a tick run one
bar is one tick: a trade lasting 45 seconds reported "329", and a six-day
backtest reported a drawdown of ~93,510 -- which a caller printed as 93,510
days, roughly 256 years.

So the engine reports the same figures twice: the bar counts, which still
mean bars, and `*_secs`, taken from the timestamps the run already carried.
These tests pin the property that actually matters -- the seconds figure
tracks the spacing of the data, and the bar count does not.

They also pin the exposure cap: time in the market cannot exceed the time
the backtest ran.
