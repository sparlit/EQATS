"""Position adoption (0.6.2) — guard tests.

Plain words: a strategy attached to a stock the user ALREADY OWNS must start
out knowing it holds those shares, at the price the user really paid, without
the engine pretending a buy happened.

The tempting shortcut — submit a fake buy at the average price — is wrong in
three ways that each cost real money or produce a false signal:

  1. it charges brokerage nobody ever paid, so every metric downstream of
     equity is off by that fee;
  2. it writes a trade into the log that never happened, so trade counts and
     win-rate describe a history the user did not live; and
  3. it emits an entry event, and a live deployment that diffs positions
     around each push reads that as "open a new position" and sends the
     broker an order to buy shares the user already holds.

So adoption opens a ledger position directly: no order, no fill, no fees, no
trade record, no Entered event. Cash drops by the cost basis so equity reads
as initial + unrealized, exactly like an account that bought earlier.

Each test below pins one of those properties. If one fails, the shortcut has
crept back in and the failure names which of the three consequences returned.

Ordering is enforced, not merely documented: adoption must happen before the
first equity sample. Adopting mid-run leaves the curve flat for the
pre-adoption stretch, which holds the running peak down and makes the later
decline measure against the wrong high-water mark — a real 0.495% drawdown
reporting as 0.199%. The curve is written streaming, so it cannot be repaired
afterwards. Quote and depth events sample no equity, so adopting after one is
still allowed; the gate is the equity curve, not the event cursor.

Deliberate refusals, also pinned here: adoption is long-only, a malformed seed
is rejected rather than skipped, and a LEVERAGED book is refused. Fully funded
books (leverage 1.0) are supported and fund the holding by locking the notional
rather than debiting cash, which is what the margin equity formula requires —
that path is what lets a long/short strategy, which must run under a margin
account for its short to transact at all, be seeded. Above leverage 1.0 the
margin a broker has already posted against a position it holds cannot be
derived from quantity and average price, and inventing a figure there would
misstate free capital, the number that decides whether the next entry is
allowed.
