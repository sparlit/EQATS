Pins the update notice: it must be useful, and it must never hurt.

The notice tells a user their raptorbt is behind the newest release. It runs on
the import path of a production trading service, so the tests that matter most
here are the negative ones -- that it stays silent when it is unsure, that it
cannot raise, and that it opens no socket when told not to.

If these fail, the risk is not a missing log line. It is an engine that is
slower to start, noisier than it should be, or that refuses to import at all
because pypi.org is having a bad day.
