//! Event-driven infrastructure for exchange-facing trading systems.
//!
//! `extrema_infra` provides the runtime layer used by strategy binaries that
//! need to combine timers, model workers, order execution, public market data,
//! and private account streams in one process. The framework is intentionally
//! small at the strategy boundary: implement [`Strategy`], register the tasks
//! your process needs, and start the environment with [`EnvBuilder`]. The
//! builder creates one broadcast stream for every concrete runtime task.
//!
//! The crate is organized around a few concepts:
//!
//! - [`Strategy`] is the unit of application logic. A binary can register one
//!   strategy module or several independent modules in the same runtime.
//! - [`EventHandler`] contains async callbacks for schedule ticks, model
//!   predictions, order execution intents, trades, LOB updates, candles, and
//!   private account updates, and raw exchange-specific websocket frames. All
//!   callbacks default to no-op.
//! - [`CommandEmitter`] gives a strategy access to task command handles after
//!   the runtime has prepared those tasks.
//! - [`TaskInfo`] declares work that the runtime owns, such as [`AltTaskInfo`]
//!   for scheduler/model/order-intent work or [`WsTaskInfo`] for websocket
//!   relays.
//! - [`TaskKey`] identifies one concrete task stream. Strategies receive every
//!   registered task by default, or can bind to selected keys. A key contains a
//!   complete [`AltTaskType`] or [`WsChannel`] plus its task id.
//! - [`prelude`] re-exports the common types used by strategy binaries.
//!
//! # Event Model
//!
//! Runtime tasks own IO, timers, model workers, and order relays. They publish
//! normalized `InfraMsg<T>` values into their task-local broadcast stream. A
//! task's lifecycle event and primary business events share that stream.
//!
//! Strategy modules handle inbound events through async callbacks and send
//! `TaskCommand` values back through command handles when they need active work
//! such as websocket connect/subscribe or order execution. Register a module
//! with `EnvBuilder::with_strategy_module` to receive all tasks, or
//! `EnvBuilder::with_strategy_module_on` to receive selected task streams.
//!
//! Market data, account updates, timers, model outputs, and order relays can
//! run on independent cadences without forcing one polling loop or one module
//! to own duplicate IO.
//!
//! # Core Trait Responsibilities
//!
//! [`Strategy`] is the lifecycle trait. It has one required startup hook,
//! `initialize`, which should complete after loading config, initializing
//! clients, or warming local state. Runtime event loops start after this phase.
//!
//! [`EventHandler`] is the inbound event surface. Its methods are callbacks:
//! `on_schedule`, `on_trade`, `on_candle`, `on_acc_pos`, `on_inst_intent`,
//! `on_order_execution`, `on_ws_other`, and so on. Every callback defaults to
//! no-op, so modules stay narrow and only implement the events that matter to
//! them. Modules receive every registered task by default; explicit task
//! bindings avoid receiver creation and wakeups for unrelated tasks.
//!
//! [`CommandEmitter`] is the outbound command surface. After tasks are prepared,
//! the runtime supplies a [`CommandRegistry`]. Strategy modules store that
//! registry, then find task handles by `(task type, task id)` or
//! `(websocket channel, task id)` when they need to send commands.
//!
//! [`MarketLobApi`], [`LobPublicRest`], [`LobPrivateRest`], and
//! [`LobWebsocket`] define exchange-client adapters. Implementations translate
//! exchange-specific REST and websocket details into the normalized data types
//! consumed by strategy modules. [`LobWsDecoder`] plugs the websocket frame
//! decoding of a venue implemented outside this crate into the runtime: register
//! it with `EnvBuilder::with_ws_decoder` and declare its tasks on
//! `Market::Custom(..)`; its events reach the same callbacks as built-in venues.
//!
//! # Event Flow
//!
//! A typical runtime flow looks like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! EnvBuilder
//!   -> registers TaskInfo values
//!   -> expands each declaration into concrete TaskKey values
//!   -> creates one broadcast stream per concrete task
//!   -> registers Strategy modules
//!   -> EnvMediator::execute()
//!       -> Strategy::initialize()
//!       -> prepare AltTask/WsTask workers and command handles
//!       -> CommandEmitter::command_init()
//!       -> subscribe strategies and spawn their event loops
//!       -> spawn prepared task workers
//!       -> tasks publish InfraMsg<T>
//!       -> EventHandler callbacks react
//!       -> strategies send TaskCommand through CommandHandle when needed
//! ```
//!
//! `InfraMsg<T>` always carries the `task_id` that emitted the event, but not the
//! full [`TaskKey`]. The builder therefore rejects id reuse within the same
//! [`AltTaskType`] or [`WsChannel`] variant, while different variants may reuse
//! an id.
//!
//! # Minimal scheduler runtime
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::{sync::Arc, time::Duration};
//!
//! use extrema_infra::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! struct Heartbeat {
//!     registry: Arc<CommandRegistry>,
//! }
//!
//! impl Heartbeat {
//!     fn new() -> Self {
//!         Self {
//!             registry: Arc::new(CommandRegistry::default()),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Strategy for Heartbeat {
//!     async fn initialize(&mut self) {
//!         // Load config, warm local state, or initialize API clients here.
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl CommandEmitter for Heartbeat {
//!     fn command_init(&mut self, registry: Arc<CommandRegistry>) {
//!         self.registry = registry;
//!     }
//!
//!     fn command_registry(&self) -> Arc<CommandRegistry> {
//!         self.registry.clone()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl EventHandler for Heartbeat {
//!     async fn on_schedule(&mut self, msg: InfraMsg<AltScheduleEvent>) {
//!         println!("schedule tick from task_id={}", msg.task_id);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> InfraResult<()> {
//!     let schedule = AltTaskInfo {
//!         alt_task_type: AltTaskType::TimeScheduler(Duration::from_secs(5)),
//!         chunk: 1,
//!         task_base_id: Some(1),
//!     };
//!
//!     let env = EnvBuilder::new()
//!         .with_task(schedule)
//!         .with_strategy_module(Heartbeat::new())
//!         .build()?;
//!
//!     env.execute().await;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Downstream usage shape
//!
//! Real strategy binaries usually follow the same shape as the minimal example:
//! build `AltTaskInfo` and `WsTaskInfo` values from config, register one or more
//! strategy modules, and call [`EnvMediator::execute`]. A simple signal process
//! may only need scheduler and intent tasks; an execution orchestrator typically
//! adds private account websocket tasks, order execution tasks, risk/evaluation
//! modules, and several independently bound strategy modules.
