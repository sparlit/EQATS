/// Binance UM/CM futures private streams use listen-key URLs/messages, Binance
/// Spot private streams use signed WS API subscription helpers, and public
/// trade/candle streams usually only need connect and subscribe.
///
/// Alt-task commands carry normalized infra data:
///
/// - `OrderExecute` forwards an order batch to an order-execution task, which
///   then emits `on_order_execution`.
/// - `InstIntent` forwards allocation/instrument/portfolio intent, which then
///   emits `on_inst_intent`.
/// - `FeatInput` forwards model features to a model task; predictions are later
///   emitted through `on_preds`.
