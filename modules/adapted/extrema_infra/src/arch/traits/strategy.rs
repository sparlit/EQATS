///
/// 1. The strategy is constructed with an empty/default registry.
/// 2. [`EnvMediator::execute`] prepares all declared [`TaskInfo`] workers and
///    their command handles without starting producers.
/// 3. The runtime builds a [`CommandRegistry`] from those handles.
/// 4. The runtime calls [`CommandEmitter::command_init`] once on each strategy.
/// 5. Strategy receivers are created, then task workers are spawned.
/// 6. Event callbacks can call [`CommandEmitter::find_alt_handle`] or
///    [`CommandEmitter::find_ws_handle`] and then send [`TaskCommand`] values.
///    Those commands are how strategies actively request websocket
///    connect/login/subscribe/shutdown, order execution, intent publication, or
///    model prediction work.
///
/// Store the registry supplied by `command_init`. Returning a fresh
/// `CommandRegistry::default()` from [`CommandEmitter::command_registry`] loses
/// all task handles, so later `find_*_handle` calls will return `None`.
///
/// Command keys contain the complete [`AltTaskType`] or [`WsChannel`] plus a task
/// id. Embedded parameters such as scheduler duration or trade-stream type are
/// part of the key; websocket market is not. Event callback envelopes expose
/// only `task_id`, so `EnvBuilder` rejects id reuse within the same enum variant.
